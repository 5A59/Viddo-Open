# Kimi K2 explained in 5 minutes

I recently watched a video and found it quite insightful. To better understand and share the content, I used **[Viddo](https://viddo.pro/)** to convert the video into a structured article, which served as the reference for this analysis.

Kimike K2 was released by Moonshot, and it's making a big impact in the AI industry. And you might say nah, I've been using Claude and Gemini and they're working just fine so why should I really care about this?

Most people probably never heard of Kimik K2 or even Moonshot because on the commercial side the market is widely dominated by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini. But there's a reason why the open model community is raving about models like Kimikk 2.

The reason why Kimikk 2 is not widely known has mostly to do with the word **large** in the large language model, meaning these open source models are still too large to run locally to get the same result as the state of the art models.

For example, Kimi K2 has a total of **1 trillion parameters**, which is comparable to other frontier models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude. The **competitive edge** that these models have over Kimikk 2 is **economies of scale**. What I mean by that is that to run a trillion parameter model for millions of users that they have, you need a **large-scale infrastructure** to support it.

And sadly, to run Kimmikk 2 you need to spend about **$25,000** minimum to purchase Nvidia's H100 card, similar to buying a brand new car. And just like owning a car, you need to put gasoline to run it. And H100 can cost up to **$90 per month** to run it locally, spending around **0.7 kilowatts**.

So you might ask at this point what's really the big deal here? Then it looks like Kimikk 2 is still not really there yet, right? Sure, the math still favors the commercial models because you only pay a subscription fee of **$200 per month** per developer to have **unlimited API calls** to use state of the art models like Claude. That's only **$2,400 per year**, which is significantly less than paying **$25,000** to run Kimik K2.

If you think about it from a company's perspective, though, paying **$2,400 per year** per developer, the math starts to tilt slowly towards the other way. For example, the **$25,000 hardware** that a company purchased could be considered as an initial investment that you pay upfront as a capital expenditure and can be depreciated in taxes.

And on top of that, the following year will only cost **$1,080 per year** in electricity costs for inference, which is far less than the **$2,400** and potentially less if the same equipment is shared between two developers.

So you can see why there's so much excitement around these models like Kimmik K2 because the open model market is slowly catching up to a point where **state of the art comparable models** like Kimmik K2 can now be harnessed locally. So the obvious next question is **how?**

How is it that Kimik K2 is able to perform so well against state of the art models like Claude GPT and Gemini? The architecture of Kimikk 2 is built around what's called **MOE** or **mixture of experts**. Most commercial models like GPT and Claude are what's called **dense models**, while Kimikk 2 is a **sparse model**.

A dense model is your typical feed forward neural network that can activate the entire model to process tokens, whereas sparse models activate only a section or few sections of the model to process your tokens. That's why even though Kimi K2 is **1 trillion parameters** in size, it actually only activates **8 sections**, in this case 8 experts per token.

The model has a total of **384 experts** that all add up to about **1 trillion parameters** in size, and this makes the inference a lot faster given the size because it only utilizes **32 billion active parameters** at a time.

Kimik 2 is also built around actions, meaning that it's specifically trained to make better tool calls. And I think this is a very important point where **LLM benchmarks**, which are typically used to measure the raw intelligence of a given model, are now expanding to look for models that are more **resourceful** in being able to leverage external services and tools to create better action.

Moonshot recognizes and specifically trained Kimik K2 on **SIM tool usage** to learn how to be resourceful in calling the right tools for **different purposes** and **different contexts**. And this will pay a huge dividend as the industry is shifting towards **MCP** and **A2A** or **Agent to Agent networks**, which requires a lot of external reliance.

My next question then is how does Kimik 2 line up with what happened back in **January 2025** when DeepSeek 1 was first released and shook the world? Remember when the announcement of Deepsea came out as **Chat GPT killer** and the stock market ended up dropping by a trillion dollars?

Eventually, will the cost of operating these models be on par with using frontier models like **OpenAI's GPT**, **Anthropic's Claude**, and **Google's Gemini?** For every major release like Deepseek1 or Kimik K2, it starts to eliminate the competitive edge that these companies currently enjoy.

And I think this is why LLM providers recognize that their competitive edge is not permanent, which is why we're seeing them expanding their product offerings to adjacent products like **AI code editors**, **AI web browsers**, and **AI chat applications**, and more because that sustains their competitive edge a little bit longer.

So as we look forward to open source models like Kimik K2 becoming more available and more useful, we'll get to see how the **industry changes**. And it'll be interesting to see where **self-hosting** will start to become the norm. Or maybe the commercial models will continue to dominate the industry because they can just put more **dollars behind** for faster innovation.

Recently I came across a video discussing the Kimike K2 model released by Moonshot, and I was quite shocked after watching it, especially considering the subtle yet strong impact it might bring to the entire AI model ecosystem.

**⚡️The inspiration behind Kimike K2 is clear and bold:** Although it’s not as well-known as GPT or Claude, it showcases the possibility of the open source community gradually catching up to commercial giants, and even being more radical in certain architectural designs. This isn’t just a technological race; it's a contest regarding “who holds the sovereignty of AI in the future.”

> **“A trillion parameters is not for showmanship; it’s for balancing precision and efficiency.”**  
> **“The MOE architecture allows K2 to activate fewer parameters but run faster.”**  
> **“Owning the model is like owning a car, rather than just buying a ticket.”**

To be honest, I initially didn't care too much about these less mainstream models because Claude and GPT already meet most of my needs. But this video made me reconsider the notion of “ownership”: is it more convenient to rent a service, or is it more liberating to own a complete system?

Kimike K2 achieves lightweight operation at a trillion-scale parameter through its Mixture of Experts architecture. Although the hardware threshold is still exorbitantly high (with H100 GPUs costing tens of thousands of dollars), from a business perspective, it may not necessarily be more expensive than subscribing to commercial APIs. More importantly, the model itself is trained to be more “hands-on”—it’s not just intelligent, but it knows how to use tools to get things done.

This is exactly what I find most compelling: **the future of AI is not just about chatting and writing, but becoming a more “capable” digital assistant.** Moonshot emphasizes “how to make AI truly productive,” and this approach resonates deeply.

Thinking along these lines, I suddenly realized: perhaps we are not just witnessing “another open source model,” but observing the genuine convergence of open source and commercial tracks. Perhaps in a year or two, the “sovereignty” of AI could indeed be in our hands. That would be the most exciting future.
