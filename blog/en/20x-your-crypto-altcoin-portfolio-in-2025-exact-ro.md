I recently watched a video about the trading journey of an experienced cryptocurrency player and his ten core lessons. Although he had experienced the roller-coaster of earning seven figures and almost losing it all, it is precisely these firsthand experiences that constitute the true value of this content.

**💡 Core Summary**

If you want to **make a big profit without being bitten by the market** in this bull run, this video is worth watching in its entirety. The host summarizes ten "don't do" key points based on his more than six years of practical experience, covering various dimensions such as buying rhythm, position management, community collaboration, and asset security. The core logic is: **Successful trading is not about being right every time, but about whether you can survive until the end and make key decisions at critical moments.**

**🧠 Personal Reflection**

After hearing his story, I felt a bit emotional and strongly resonated with his statement, “In the previous round, it was about being a lone wolf; in this round, we need to band together.” I had a similar experience a few years ago; initially, I made some earnings from a few lucky trades, but without a selling strategy, I was completely bewildered when the market crashed. Especially when he mentioned, “Before you buy, you should know when to sell,” I am increasingly able to relate to this.

Additionally, his constant emphasis on **the power of community** deeply touched me. We often say DYOR (Do Your Own Research), but in reality, most people lack the ability to make complete judgments. At this time, a reliable circle is not only a source of information but also an emotional anchor. Having someone remind you not to chase highs, someone suggest taking profits, or someone say, “I’ve also stepped on a landmine,” provides a sense of companionship and cross-validation that is unattainable in the lone wolf era.

The final sentiment I want to add is: **The essence of trading is emotional management, not a numbers game.** Those who can recognize this in advance are already half a cycle ahead of most people. I wish you can stay steady, see clearly, and enter the market before the next FOMO comes. 💪
