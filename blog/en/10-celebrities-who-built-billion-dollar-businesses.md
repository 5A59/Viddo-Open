# 10 Celebrities Who Built Billion Dollar Businesses

I recently came across a video that I found very interesting, and I can't help but want to share it. It discusses how today's celebrities are no longer just famous; they are using their influence to build real business empires.

**Fame is no longer the prize — it's just the entry ticket.** Celebrities today aren’t stopping at being popular — they’re thinking like entrepreneurs. **Whether it’s Rihanna’s Fenty, Ryan Reynolds’ gin company, or Roger Federer’s stake in ON Running, the smartest celebrities are building long-term wealth, not just cashing checks.** It’s not about slapping their name on a product anymore — it’s about strategic, authentic partnerships and creating brands that actually mean something. And the best part? **These same ideas can work for anyone — even without the red carpet.**

Watching that video made me pause and think — what am I actually building for the long haul? I’ve always admired the hustle behind some of these brands, but realizing how much *strategy* goes into them really changed my view. It’s not about being famous — it’s about **being intentional with your influence**, however big or small. I don’t need millions of followers to start thinking like a founder. **Maybe my brand is just me right now — but that’s enough to begin.** Seeing how people like Dr. Dre or Serena Williams used ownership to multiply their impact makes me want to look at every opportunity and ask, *is this a quick win or a legacy move?* Definitely a mindset I’m going to carry forward.

**P.S.** If you’re feeling stuck or unsure where to start, maybe the first step is just to ask: *What do I believe in enough to build something around it?*
