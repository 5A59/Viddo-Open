# QWEN 3 CODER is Unleashed... better than KIMI K2

I recently watched a video and found it quite insightful. To better understand and share the content, I used **[Viddo](https://viddo.pro/)** to convert the video into a structured article, which served as the reference for this analysis.

**Original Video:** [Watch Video](> - Alibaba has unveiled the Quin 3 coder, a powerful new open-source coding model.
> - It features a massive 480 billion parameter model called Powerful1.
> - The Quin 3 coder excels in various benchmarks and outperforms competitors.
> - A command line tool for ageentic coding, Quin Code, is now available.
> - New methods in reinforcement learning enhance real-world coding task performance.

Alibaba just dropped the next big thing. **Quin 3 coder**. Just as the world is getting used to **Kimi K2**, the other big open-source coding model, Alibaba drops the **Quin 3 coder** and the Quin 3 coder is available in multiple sizes.

But the big one, the **Powerful1**, is Quin 3 Coder 480B A35B instruct, meaning that this is a **480 billion parameter model**. It's built with a mixture of experts, so only **35 billion parameters are active during any call**. Instruct means that it's our friendly and helpful assistant mode as opposed to the base model that's a little bit more like a text completion model.

Nataly supports **256k context** and it scales up to **1 million**. And as you can see here, the benchmarks look great now. Can't always just trust the benchmarks, so give it a few days while everybody gets their hands on it and tests it out.

But **Kimi K2** by all accounts was extremely impressive. The **Gwin 3 coder** handily beats Kimi K2. Not only that, but it's comparable. It's competitive with **Claud Sounded**. It also beats **OpenAI's GPT 4.1** and scores very strong on **ageentic browser use** as well as ageentic tool use. Again, only Cloud Sounded 4 edges it out in some of the cases.

The **Gwin team** promises that it works seamlessly with Community's best developer tools and it can be used anywhere across the digital world. Age genic coding in the world and they're not kidding about this.

Alongside the model, they're open sourcing a command line tool for ageentic coding called **Quin Code**. It's forked from **Google's Gemini code**. As you can see here, it's open sourced on **GitHub Apache 2.0 license**. It looks a lot like the claw code and it's been adapted with customized prompts and function calling protocols to fully unleash the capabilities of Quin 3 coder on ageentic coding tasks.

So basically **Quin code** is just adapted **Gemini cli**. It's been modified to use the Quwin models. You can also use the **Quin 3 coder models** with **cloud code**. A lot of people prefer cloud code, so you can easily use the Quin 3 Codder models with Cloud code. You're able to use it with **K Clin**. I'll leave these links down below.

One of the big subjects of discussion right now is **reinforcement learning**. Taking these models and taking them to an RL gym to teach them how to do various skills like coding, mathematics, etc. As I say here, scaling code Reinforcement learning is hard to solve, easy to verify as you can see here.

As they're increasing training steps as they train this model, it's going up and up across all the different areas of performance like code generation, software development, competitive coding, **SQL instruction following**, etc. They take a bit of a stab at the other frontier lab saying unlike the prevailing focus on competition level code generation in the community, we believe all code tasks are naturally well suited for execution driven large scale RL reinforcement learning.

That's why we scaled code RL training on a broader set of real-world coding tasks. Basically they're saying that instead of trying to max out these quizzes and tests, these competition style questions, they're actually training this model to do **real work in the real world**.

By automatically scaling and test cases of diverse coding tasks, we created high-quality training instances and successfully unlocked the full potential of reinforcement learning. It not only significantly boosted code execution success rates but also brought gains to other tasks.

This means that this approach generalizes. We've seen in other published papers that for example, training it to do code improves its ability to do math problems for example, even though it's not explicitly trained on that. Certainly, it seems like their approach generalizes across a lot of different tasks. Hopefully, they'll publish a paper later that's going to outline how they approach this.

But here they mentioned that their approach is using hard to solve easy to verify tasks as a fertile ground for large scale and reinforcement learning.

So here's a chart of its performance on the **SUI bench Verified** so this is the size of the model. Models on the right are bigger, models on the left are smaller and the higher you go the better the score is on the subench verified. SWbench is **500 real-world human verified Python GitHub issues** reviewed by humans and confirmed solvable.

As you can see here, **Quin 3 coder** is above most of the other models that we've seen including **Kimmy K2**, **GPT 4.1**, even **Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview**. Only **Cloud Sont 4** slightly edges them out while being a much bigger model. For being a moderately sized model, nothing is even close to it in terms of performance. **Kimmik K2** is much larger while not as good.

Importantly, with **real-world software engineering tasks** like those in the **SUI bench verified**, Quin 3 coder must engage in multi-turn interactions with the environment involving planning, using tools, receiving feedback and making decisions. So this isn't a simple question-answer format. This is a long horizon task that includes planning and feedback.

What was their trick in getting this model to be so good at those long horizon tasks? Justing here that in the post-training phase of **Quint threeoder** they introduced **Long Horizon rl**. They're referring to it as **Agent rl**. This was to encourage the model to solve those real-world tasks through multi-turn interactions using tools.

This is interesting. The key challenge in doing something like this **Agent rl** lies in environment scaling. To address this, they built a **scalable system** capable of running **20,000 independent environments in parallel**. They did this using **Alibaba's cloud infrastructure**.

This allowed them the scale needed to run this massive reinforcement learning pipeline. And this is what allowed **Coin 3 Coder** to achieve the **state of the art performance** among open source models without—and this is important to note—without test time scaling. This is not a reasoning model. Unlike the **DeepSeq R1** or the **Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview**, this is non-reasoning.

Some of the demonstrations they posted include building demolition and demonstration. Here’s using **Quinn with Klein**, they put together an interactive color explosion. Looks pretty neat.

So we're going to have to test some of these things out: **3D Google Earth terrain visualization**, a little app to test your typing speed, bouncing ball in rotating, a hyper cube, super trippy solar system simulation, and a duet game. It's available on how you face and chat **Quen AI**.

So I'm going to be doing a full round of testing on this thing, but for the time being, here's just a few quick tests that I ran. One is doing a simulation of an office building with desks and offices inside. So I tried to get it to do some sort of **transparent windows** on the outside, but it wasn't able to do transparency. They were either very opaque or completely not transparent.

But it did manage to create, you know, the rooms inside with desks and computers and whatever that is. A light looks like a light in each room. So so far, from the beginning it's not too bad. I mean this is pretty good for the first attempt.

I also created a little **drone flying game** where you're able to fly a drone around the city. I can't complain. It's pretty good. I mean the keys are a little bit weird, but I'm liking it so far. It takes a little bit getting used to, but once you're able to kind of just feather the throttle, you're able to fly around and it's not bad for one-shotting it.

We have a **Minecraft clone**. Where would we be without a Minecraft clone? You're able to place blocks and build and move around. Not too bad, I was able to one-shot this pretty easily.

So check it out, let me know what you think about it. More tests and use cases are coming very, very soon. Also, somebody made this little hack for **clot code** and now why didn't we have this all along?

Through the task list. Creating the **to-do list**. Sir. Beginning Python code adjustments. Make it so number one. Working through the task list. Actually, that might get kind of annoying pretty quick.

And I gotta say, I did not expect open-source AI to be this good. I think we were hoping that it would be, let's say at the most a few years behind the frontier labs. Now, it's looking like it's months. **What a time to be alive**.)

I recently watched a video, and it mentioned: **Alibaba released an open-source large model called Quin 3 coder, which not only has a large number of parameters but also performs exceptionally well in real-world tasks, even surpassing GPT-4.1 and Kimi K2 in certain tasks, which is quite impressive.**

---

**Quin 3 coder** feels like a bold statement from Alibaba to the AI world. In a space where every frontier lab is racing toward more intelligent, capable code generation models, Quin 3 drops in not just to participate—but to compete seriously. It comes in many sizes, but the flagship **Powerful1** model is a 480B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, with only 35B parameters active per call. That’s smart scaling. Combine that with **256k+ context length**, strong benchmark results, and open-source tools like **Quin Code**—it’s clearly meant to be both powerful and practical.

**What really impressed me**, though, is the model’s **focus on real-world coding tasks**, not just benchmarks. They’re using reinforcement learning, not for fancy scores, but to teach the model how to interact, plan, take feedback, and use tools. That’s **Agent RL**—multi-turn, tool-augmented, feedback-based training. Plus, running **20,000 environments in parallel** using Alibaba Cloud? That’s no joke. This is engineering muscle at scale.

---

**✨ Here’s the core of it:**

- **Quin 3 coder** is a massive, highly optimized MoE code model with serious real-world capabilities.
- It outperforms or matches top models like GPT-4.1 and Kimi K2 in coding benchmarks and tool use.
- Through large-scale **reinforcement learning on real tasks**, it’s trained for true practical usage—not just synthetic benchmarks.
- It’s fully open-source and designed to plug seamlessly into common dev workflows like Cloud Code and command-line tools.
- Alibaba’s infrastructure advantage enabled parallel training on an unprecedented scale—critical for this level of RL.

**💬 A few lines that stuck with me:**

1. “What a time to be alive.”  
2. “We believe all code tasks are naturally well suited for execution-driven large-scale RL.”  
3. “Quin 3 coder isn’t just solving quizzes—it’s learning to code like a real dev.”

---

**🙋‍♀️ Personally, here’s what I felt:**

I’ve always been a little skeptical of benchmark hype. Numbers are cool, but do they translate to work? That’s why Quin 3 coder caught my eye—it’s trained not for leaderboard scores, but for real-world coding, where context, iteration, and feedback matter. I love how it embraces **messy, multi-step tasks**—the kind we actually deal with when building software. It’s exciting to see an open-source model not only catch up to the frontier but challenge it by thinking differently. And this idea that **learning to code better improves math and vice versa?** That’s wild. I’m honestly inspired—and a little impatient to try it out myself.
