# 10 Apps That Turn Your Mobile into a Hacking Supercomputer!

I recently came across a video that discussed how to turn a phone into a "hacking supercomputer," and the content was quite explosive. The speaker introduced 10 incredible tools for ethical hacking and penetration testing, and after watching, I couldn't help but marvel at the profound power that lies within the phones we carry in our pockets.

**🔍 Key Summary**

A mobile phone is not just a communication tool; it can also be a complete penetration testing lab. The video detailed 10 hacking tools available on the Android platform, such as Kali Nethunter, Termux, and Andro Rat, each boasting powerful features ranging from network scanning to remote control. However, the prerequisite is: **they must be used within legal and ethical frameworks**. These tools are designed to help us better understand, test, and strengthen cybersecurity.

**💭 Personal Reflections**

Seeing these tools, my first reaction was shock: **I can’t believe my phone can do so many things!** Upon further reflection, the underlying logic is closely tied to the network environment we encounter daily. Whether it’s securing home WiFi, identifying vulnerabilities in company devices, or monitoring app data flow, these tools can be incredibly helpful.

I particularly appreciated the video’s attitude of “not promoting attacks but encouraging defense.” As ordinary people, we may not be cybersecurity experts, but we can be wiser users. **Understanding attack paths gives us the ability to fortify our defenses.** Now I even want to try writing a small script in Termux to automatically check the port status of my home router; just thinking about it gives me a sense of accomplishment.

Overall, this type of content not only enlightens us about technology but also awakens my awareness of the "survival skills in the digital world." In the future, not understanding some “anti-hacking mindset” might make me feel a bit uneasy.
