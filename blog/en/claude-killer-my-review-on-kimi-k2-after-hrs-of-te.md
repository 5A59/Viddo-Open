# Claude Killer? My review on Kimi K2 after hrs of testing...

I recently watched a video and found it quite insightful. To better understand and share the content, I used **[Viddo](https://viddo.pro/)** to convert the video into a structured article, which served as the reference for this analysis.

**Original Video:** [Watch Video](> - I was able to put the new Kimme K2 model into cloud code.
> - This model is something truly different, with impressive capabilities.
> - The Kimi K2 model is incredibly low-cost compared to alternatives.
> - I conducted experiments with UI and game design, yielding promising results.
> - Building AI coding agents becomes remarkably affordable with the Kimi K2.

I was able to put the new **Kimme K2 model** into **cloud code**. It was able to create this whole high quality **UI component library** including file explorer, text editor, app view, and resizable panels and put together an online **IDE UI** like this as well as a fully functional manual type game with just a fraction, of course, of what you would normally be charged from **Entropic API**.

And I know there are new models coming out all the time, but this Kimi K2 model is something truly different. So when it comes to AI coding, **Entropic Cloud** has been the best model out there. There are not even many other choices like **GPT 4.1 model**; coding capability does not even come close.

But the issue is that **Cloud 4 model cost** is extremely high. I was trying to build this coding agent for **super design dev**, and that‚Äôs where I couldn‚Äôt figure out how possible we could make using those **Entropic models**.

And that‚Äôs also the point I realized all those **AI coding platforms** like **L Bo** or **Bold** very likely are not making much profit if their customers are using the product too much. But that is going to change completely with this **Kimi K2 model**.

So Kimi K2 is a new **open-source model** introduced by an AI company in China called **Moonshot**. It has quite **impressive coding capabilities** on the benchmarks but most importantly, their price is insanely low compared with **Cloud full Model** or even **GPT 4.1**, where **Cloud 4** charges **dollars per million input token** and dollars for output token.

The **Kimi K2 model** charges only a fraction of it with **60 cents for 1 million input tokens** and **$2.5 for the output token**. This means if you switch to **Kimme K2 model**, you will cut costs by **80%** immediately.

I did some tests, and the performance of the **Kimmi model** looks really promising. It almost feels like somewhere between **Cloud 3.5 and Cloud 4**, so it is good enough but **80% cheaper**.

Today, I want to show you how you can use the **Kimi model** in your own application as well as cloud code.

There are a few ways you can experiment with the **Kimi K2 model**. The easiest one is you can just go to **kimme.com** and start giving it prompts. Here, I just gave **screenshot Twitter** and asked to **rebuild the UI**. It will automatically generate this amazing UI replica, so you can just go to **Kimi.com** to try it out.

On the side, the more fun ways to use **Kimi K2** is obviously using their **API endpoint** and the price, as I mentioned before, is pretty insanely cheap considering their performance.

The best part is that it‚Äôs extremely easy to use their API because you just change the **base URL** and pass on the **API key**. It works just like a normal **OpenAI client** that you created before.

But the best way to experience **Kimi K2** is actually to integrate it into **cloud code**, so that it leverages both the coding capability as well as the agentic tool core capability.

The easiest way to integrate is that you can just open your terminal and do:)

I recently watched a video about an AI model sharing, discussing a new model called **Kimi K2** integrated into cloud code. The whole process was extremely smooth and efficient, which made me exclaim, ‚ÄúThis stuff is just too good!‚Äù

---

**üí° Core Summary:**

**Kimi K2 is an open-source AI model launched by China‚Äôs Moonshot, boasting a very low price and excellent performance, nearly rivaling Cloud 4.** It excels in code generation, UI construction, and game design, making it suitable for developers to integrate into their products or cloud workflows. More crucially, it significantly lowers the development threshold for AI programming agents at costs far below GPT-4.1 or Entropic.

---

**üéØ Key Quotes:**

- ‚ÄúKimi K2 can save you 80% of your costs.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúPerformance close to Cloud 4, but only costs a few cents per million tokens.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúJust change the base URL, and you can start using it.‚Äù

**üß† Personal Thoughts:**

As someone who has been following the practical applications of AI, I was truly excited when I saw this sharing. Nowadays, everyone is talking about performance comparisons, context length, and reasoning ability, but to be honest‚Äî**‚ÄúWho is cheaper and easier to integrate‚Äù is the key factor for me to decide whether to use it.** The positioning of Kimi K2 as ‚Äúusable + cost-effective‚Äù aligns perfectly with the actual needs of many startup teams and independent developers.

What struck me even more is that not only is it affordable, but it can also produce complete UIs, such as file managers, text editors, and game interfaces. This means it has moved from ‚Äúgenerating snippets of code‚Äù to the stage of ‚Äúbuilding product modules.‚Äù The emergence of such a model will truly change the underlying strategies of a large number of AI tool platforms and even reshape the entire definition of the ‚ÄúAI engineer‚Äù profession.

In the future, we might no longer be ‚Äúusing AI to write code,‚Äù but rather ‚Äúusing AI to directly create products.‚Äù Kimi K2 has shown me that this future might arrive sooner than I imagined.
