# 10 Things You Should Avoid Revealing In A Job Interview - Interview Tips

I recently came across a video that discusses what to avoid saying in a job interview. To be honest, it was very practical and valuable, especially for those preparing for an interview; it was essentially a "pitfall guide."

**ðŸ’¡ Key Summary**

Some seemingly "harmless" remarks during an interview can actually directly impact your chances of being hired. Disclosing too much personal information, the true reasons for leaving a previous job, salary history, or health statusâ€”these can all be misinterpreted and may even trigger biases. **The essence of an interview is information screening; the clearer, more restrained, and more focused you are on the current position, the easier it is to gain trust.**

**ðŸ“Œ Key Quotes Extracted**

- "Don't let a few inadvertently spoken words land you on the 'not considered' list."
- "It's not about being dishonest; it's about smartly packaging the key points you want to express."
- "Your value shouldn't be determined by your previous salary."

**ðŸ§  My Thoughts**

The biggest takeaway from the video for me is: **An interview isnâ€™t about telling the truth; itâ€™s about telling the strategic truth.** That kind of "I am who I am" frankness, if not well-packaged, can feel like self-exposure. In a setting meant for judgment and evaluation, any information could be interpreted as a risk.

For example, saying "My boss was difficult, so I left" during an interview may seem like you're expressing a victim narrative, but HR might hear "You're hard to work with." Similarly, mentioning that you want to start your own business in five years sounds like having a plan, but it might imply "instability" concerning the current job.

**Therefore, an interview is not about showcasing who you are but about demonstrating what you can become in this role.** You may have larger dreams, but you need to convince people that you genuinely care about this position right now; you might have an unfortunate background, but itâ€™s more important to show your ability to solve problems rather than the dilemmas themselves.

In summary, **the more critical the situation, the more strategic your expression needs to be. Being sincere does not mean being indiscriminately open; it means knowing when to "leave things unsaid."**
