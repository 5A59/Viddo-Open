I recently watched a video about a girl‚Äôs experience of making money while traveling, and it really gave me a "wow" feeling.

**You might not believe it, but** a person can indeed travel the world and earn money with just a laptop and a mobile phone. Angelica Wanders has done it, and she has been doing it for five years. Not only has she traveled to dozens of cities around the globe, but she has also summarized 10 online ways to "earn while you travel"‚Äîfrom teaching, writing books, and creating courses to freelancing, e-commerce, video making, and more. The key is that these methods do not require you to be an expert or have significant capital; as long as you‚Äôre willing to learn and try, you can turn location freedom into your daily life.

üåü **Some particularly striking sentences:**

1. **‚ÄúLocation freedom means you can live wherever you want to work.‚Äù**  
2. **‚ÄúI don‚Äôt chase luxury cars or watches; I pursue the freedom to leave at any time.‚Äù**  
3. **‚ÄúAs long as you earn more today than you spend, you‚Äôve won.‚Äù**

The phrases that resonated most with me were "time freedom" and "location freedom." I used to think that travel required saving up money, and that earning money and vacationing were conflicting activities. But now, more and more people are choosing to switch their work mode to one that is ‚Äúmobile,‚Äù effectively setting their ‚Äúoffice location‚Äù in Bali, Paris, or Cebu.

In fact, I‚Äôve had similar fantasies, like writing copy in a caf√© in Kyoto or editing a PowerPoint by the beach in Vietnam. It sounds like a dream, but after watching her video, I realized that the threshold isn't as high as I thought. As long as I‚Äôm willing to let go of the obsession with having a fixed job, willing to try self-employment, content creation, or even just starting with part-time work, I can gradually move closer to a life of "earning while I travel."

So this is not just a way to make money; it‚Äôs a redefinition of life choices. And it seems that I‚Äôm no longer so afraid to start.
