### **🧠 Personal Impressions**

After watching the video, my biggest takeaway was: **“In the workplace, we often don’t have trouble speaking English, but rather we don’t know how to ‘speak English naturally.’”** Even though I can talk, I always worry that I might not sound authentic, which makes me seem stiff. The expressions in the video are practical and closely relate to real-life scenarios, and they can be articulated without needing complex vocabulary. Especially phrases like “Let’s get started,” which seems simple, **but using it instantly brings you closer to the participants**, unlike the scripted “Now we shall commence the meeting.”  

I also realized that leading a meeting is actually more about building a smooth communication process—not about showboating, but enabling everyone to participate and contribute. Moving forward, whether I am leading a team or collaborating internationally, these phrases will help me manage the rhythm of meetings with more confidence and naturalness. **Language is a tool; the key is that we should use it to ‘build bridges’ rather than ‘set barriers.’**
